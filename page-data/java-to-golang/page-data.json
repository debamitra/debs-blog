Go was designed originally as more of a systems-level programming language with features of C/C++ but without their problems. It takes the best from them and Java to give you a better language to work with. Go is simple to learn, fast, is slightly more opinionated about best practices for writing clean and efficient code, handles concurrency really really well and Go code is quite easy to reason about unlike Java.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Why learn Golang?
